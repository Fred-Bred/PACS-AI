title = "Exploring the Application of NLP in Narrative Patterns of Adult Attachment",
abstract = "The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is a protocol-based, semi-structured interview method widely used to measure adults{\textquoteright} states of mind with respect to attachment. Recently, transcripts of this interview have been used to code secure base script knowledge, which is script-like knowledge related to the way parents dealt with their distress during childhood (ie., child went to parent for comfort, parent provided instrumental and emotional support, child went back to play). Manually coding the verbatim transcripts is labor-intensive and requires a lot of centralized training. The potential integration of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques may automate certain aspects of AAI analysis, potentially optimizing the process. The aim of this research project is to explore the practical application of these technologies in analyzing AAI transcripts.The project uses data from a pooled set of 12 studies originating from four countries. Upon reviewing the 1,410 AAI transcripts in this set (conducted in three languages), notable discrepancies in the administration of the interviews emerged, some of which may affect the suitability of the interview to assess secure base script knowledge. The first focus of this research project is therefore to develop a model to automatically assess the quality of the transcripts, first for English studies and then for all studies and languages. This model will prioritize evaluating interview characteristics, including instances of unintelligibility and non-adherence to the prescribed AAI protocol. As a next step in the project, employing sentiment analysis will enable an investigation into the correlation between participant-provided adjectives and their corresponding narratives. Finally, this research project will explore the possibility of automatically coding secure base script knowledge in AAI transcripts. By combining technological advances with nuanced human insights, this research project not only provides a pathway toward research studies at scale, but also presents an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding of emotional and cognitive dimensions within attachment narratives.",

   abstract = {The alliance continues to be one of the most investigated variables related to success in psychotherapy irrespective of theoretical orientation. We define and illustrate the alliance (also conceptualized as therapeutic alliance, helping alliance, or working alliance) and then present a meta-analysis of 295 independent studies that covered more than 30,000 patients (published between 1978 and 2017) for face-to-face and Internet-based psychotherapy. The relation of the alliance and treatment outcome was investigated using a three-level meta-analysis with random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood estimators. The overall alliance-outcome association for face-to-face psychotherapy was r-.278 (95% confidence intervals [.256, .299], p .0001; equivalent of d-.579). There was heterogeneity among the effect sizes, and 2% of the 295 effect sizes indicated negative correlations. The correlation for Internet-based psychotherapy was approximately the same (viz., r-.275, k-23). These results confirm the robustness of the positive relation between the alliance and outcome. This relation remains consistent across assessor perspectives, alliance and outcome measures, treatment approaches, patient characteristics, and countries. The article concludes with causality considerations, research limitations, diversity considerations, and therapeutic practices.},

   abstract = {Objective: Alliance, empathy, and genuineness are each integral parts of the therapeutic relationship. No previous meta-analysis has explored the extent to which therapist empathy and genuineness contribute to the therapeutic alliance. Method: In this meta-analysis, a multifaceted search strategy yielded 53 studies. Forty studies reported alliance/empathy relationships, eight studies reported alliance/genuineness relationships, and five studies reported both. Results: Random effects meta-analyses revealed that therapeutic alliance was significantly related to perceptions of therapist empathy with a mean r = 0.50 (95% CI = 0.42, 0.57). Therapeutic alliance was also significantly related to perceptions of therapist genuineness with a mean r = 0.59 (95% CI = 0.45, 0.71). Tests of publication bias indicated a low likelihood of publication bias affecting the strength and direction of the results. Potential moderating variables were explored, including rater perspective, measure of therapeutic relationship variables, and client race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Therapeutic alliance has a moderate relationship with perceptions of therapist empathy and genuineness. Of note, there may be reason to believe that when rated by the same person, these constructs have significant overlap and lack discreteness. Future directions for study of the therapeutic relationship are discussed. Implications for practice are provided.},

   abstract = {The alliance-outcome relationship has been consistently linked to positive treatment outcomes irrespective of psychotherapy modality. However, beyond its general links to favorable treatment outcomes, it is less clear whether the alliance is a specific mediator of change and thus a possible mechanism underlying psychotherapy response. This systematic review evaluated research examining the alliance as a potential mediator of symptom change, reviewing study characteristics of 37 relevant articles examining the alliance-outcome relationship and the extent to which these studies met recommended criteria for mechanistic research. Alliance mediated therapeutic outcomes in 70.3% of the studies. We observed significant heterogeneity across studies in terms of methodology, including timing of alliance assessment, study design, constructs used in mediation models, and analytic approaches. Building on recent methodological advancements, we propose directions for future research examining the putative mediational role of alliance, such as greater uniformity in and attention to study design and statistical methodology. This review highlights the importance of alliance in therapeutic change and discusses how adhering to requirements for process research will improve our ability to more precisely estimate how and to what extent alliance drives therapeutic change.},
