# 1. Introduction
- Terminology
	- Patient/client
		- As norms differ between therapeutic traditions and the countries where the sessions studied in this thesis were held, some terminology may be used interchangeably in this manuscript. These include client and patient which are used interchangeably. The terms therapist, counsellor, and psychologist are also applied indiscriminately.
		- When the term patient is used, it is mainly to comply with the broader literature. The author acknowledges the inherent medicalisation or resulting pathologisation that may follow from this but intends the term only to indicate the receiver of treatment of psychological distress in its various forms
	- Child/infant
		- The term infant describes different age ranges dependent on country and context.
	- Theory terms
		- "Cannot classify", a fourth insecure adult attachment style is not generally covered in research
		- Avoidant and dismissing are used to refer to the same type of insecure adult attachment style. Likewise, preoccupied and anxious are used to refer to the same insecure style. Finally, unresolved and disorganised refer to the adult attachment style of being unresolved in relation to loss or trauma as the term disorganised is often used in clinical settings to describe this style.
# 2. Theory
## 2.1. Attachment

### 2.1.1. Theoretical development
- Bowlby
	- Phylogenetic
		- An attachment system developed through human, and generally mammalian, evolutionary history to encourage infants to maintain proximity to their caretakers, particularly so during conditions of threat. This system is activated when a threat is perceived and attachment behaviours tend to follow. The nature of these behaviours depends on the attachment style of the individual which determine the strategies employed to regulate affect and cope with distress and the perceived threat.
	- Ontogenetic
		- Infants develop expectations of the responsiveness of their caregivers based on experience. These expectations tend to stay with them into adolescence and adulthood, forming rather stable mental models of close and intimate relationships which influence expectations, behaviours, and self-regulation throughout life.
	- "According to this perspective, individual differences in attachment styles reﬂect rules and strategies which children learn about handling negative emotion. These rules are learned through experiences of caregivers’ responses to attachment-related distress, but generalize to other distressing situations. Secure children, who usually experience responsive caregiving, learn to acknowledge their distress and seek help from others. In contrast, insecure children learn strategies which are adaptive in the short term (because they take account of caregivers’ attitudes and behaviours), but maladaptive in the longer-term. Avoidant children learn to deny or suppress their distress, so as not to risk further distancing or alienation on the part of caregivers. Anxious-ambivalent children tend to be overly vigilant to negative events and express their upset very strongly, to ensure a response from inconsistent caregivers." \cite[p. 280]{Feeney2000}

	- Critique
- Seeks to fill the empirical and theoretical or mechanistic void that was the centre of much of the critique.
	- Wikipedia [formulation of the theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Formulation_of_the_theory)
	- Unification of psychoanalysis and ethology \cite{bowlby1953critical}
- Bowlby considered the development of attachment and its related behaviours from both ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives.
- Whereas most early theory statements and empirical analyses focused on the mother-child relationship, there is now a vast literature extending the theory to other caregivers including fathers, extended family members, educators, friends, and romantic relationships.

Towards clinical applications
- Bowlby was himself a psychoanalyst and psychotherapist and the therapeutic process and how it could be informed by attachment theory was one of the primary interests for Bowlby, and thus, an important driver for the formation of the theory. Bowlby gave a number of lectures and published several articles giving explicit advice on the application of attachment theory for clinical practice \cite{Bowlby2005b}.
- While pleased with the extended research into the development of children, on several occasions, Bowlby expressed his disappointment with how little momentum the theory had gathered in clinical circles \cite{Bowlby1988}.

### 2.1.2. Modern view of attachment and its significance for health and daily life
While attachment is measured with a variety of methods with varying degrees of granularity today, they tend to share the underlying structure of attachment styles. This structure can be thought of as describing the main tenets of attachment theory as it is understood and applied today.
- Levels of analysis
	- 3, 4, or 7
- Stability
	- An individuals state of mind with regards to attachment is theorised to be relatively stable throughout the lifespan.
		- This is mostly based on... GET SOURCE
	- \cite{Scharfe1994}
	- \cite{Zhang2004}
		- In the empirical literature, attachement classifications tend to show both stability and fluidity, with studies involving younger individuals finding somewhat stable patterns with a greater degree of fluidity and studies of older individuals finding much greater stability.
		- In a study by Zhang and Labouvie-Vief \cite{Zhang2004}, a sample of 370 individuals ranging in age form 15 to 87 was assessed regarding attachment, well-being, coping strategies, and depressive symptoms three times over a six year period. Attachment style was found to be reasonably stable but it did fluctuate. Test-rest reliability in this sample was between .40 and .49 between the first and second assessment and between .24 and .45 between the first and third measurement.
		- The changes observed are themselves relevant to our understanding of the development, stability, and significance of attachment. Namely, Zhang and Labouvie-Vief found that change towards greater attachment insecurity was associated with defensive coping strategies characterised by rigid, immature and maladaptive ways of interacting with the world. Depressive symptoms was also a significant predictor of change towards greater insecurity. In contrast, change towards greater security was predicted by flexible and reality-oriented coping strategies and better perceived well-being \cite{Zhang2004}.
		- Over time, adults may become more secure and more dismissive but less preoccupied, according to the effect of age observed by Zhang and Labouvie-Vief \cite{Zhang2004}.
	- \cite{Magai2006}
		- Lending further support to the notion of increased attachment stability with age, Consedine and Magai assessed attachement in 415 older adults at age 72 and again at age 78. In this sample, 81.4 % of participants remained stable in their classification.
	- \cite{Pinquart2013}
		- Empirical evidence also points to mostly stable patterns of attachment over long periods of time. This is perhaps most convincingly demonstrated by a 2013 meta-analysis of 127 studies on attachment stability with a total \textit{n} of 21,072 by Pinquart, Fueßner, and Ahnert \cite{Pinquart2013}. Here, the authors found medium-sized stability with an test-retest coefficient of .39. However, while no significant stability was detectable in studies running longer than 15 years, coefficients were larger for shorter time intervals and for samples not comprised of at-risk children.
		- This suggests that the applied attachment measures have good reliability, and that while attachment displays good stability for shorter time intervals, life events, circumstances and perhaps deliberate interventions can change it over longer intervals.
	- \cite{McConnell2011}
		- McConnel \cite{McConnell2011} points out that the factors influencing attachment in adulthood are more complex, ranging from internal and behavioural factors such as coping and well-being to external factors like life events and environmental stress. This may make attachment more malleable through deliberately intervention in adulthood and more difficult to predict over very long periods \cite{Pinquart2013}.
	- However, it is important to note that even if attachment is mostly stable, with changes due to circumstances, it is not immutable. In fact, change in attachment style is a common goal in psychotherapy and changes are not uncommonly observed following major life events such as loss, change in relationship status, or becoming a parent.
		- \cite{Kirkpatrick1994} (for relationship initiation or breakup mediating attachment stability)
	- With the relative stability and some understanding of the changing of attachment styles established, I will now turn to the importance of attachment security in a wider context. As such, the next sections cover the predictive value of the theory and its constructs in regards to relationships, daily life, health, psychopathology, and mental health. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review but rather I aim to elucidate the remarkable extent to which attachment permeates pivotal facets of human experience. Consequently it will serve to illustrate the value of the construct as pliable, accessible, and informative variable for patients and clinicians alike.

#### 2.1.2.1. Relationships and daily life
- Attachment insecurity is associated with lower levels of relationship evaluations even when controlling for important factors such as gender roles, romantic beliefs, and self-esteem \cite{Rodriguez2021, Jones1996}.
- In promoting relationship satisfaction and security for anxious and avoidant individuals in romantic relationships, some strategies are more successful than others \cite{Overall2015}. The insights gained from research into regulation of attachment insecurity in romantic relationships may guide how clinicians approach patients with different attachment patterns and help them distinguish the best strategies for treatment and building a strong therapeutic alliance.
- Insecurely attached partners in romantic relationships tend to react in a counterproductive manner when faced with interdependence dilemmas in their romantic relations \cite{Simpson2012}.
- Attachment styles influence how individuals process events and attachment cues in their relationships. This may lead to biased expectations and perceptions of their relationships and partners and eventually interfere with well-functioning relationship processes \cite{Collins2007, Collins2004, Hazan1994, Mikulincer2003, Rodriguez2019}.
- Cognitive appraisals, social functioning, and moment-to-moment affective states as examined using experience sampling methods are predicted by attachment style. Namely, individuals with anxious attachment may experience higher negative affect, stress and perceive more social rejection in their day-to-day experience and interactions. Individuals with avoidant attachment, however, seem to experience greater degree of deactivation such as decreased positive states and lowered desire for social interaction when alone \cite{Sheinbaum2015}.
	- Individuals with anxious attachment experience social situations with low levels of rated "closeness" significantly more negatively than those with secure attachment

#### 2.1.2.2. Health, psychopathology, and mental health
- Attachement theory and its supporting evidence have serious implications for general healthcare with associations reaching from the symptoms experienced and reported to the tendency to visit health professionals. Anxious attachement has been linked to higher symptom-reporting. This association is robust even when controlling for general negative emotionality, suggesting that those with anxious attachement may be more prone to experience or report signs of distress. The same study also found that avoidant attachment was associated with fewer visits to health professionals, even when symptom reports were controlled for, suggesting that avoidant attachment is associated with delayed seeking of medical care \cite{Feeney1994}.
- A 2018 meta-analysis found that insecure attachment was associated with increased risk of depression \cite{Dagan2018}.
- A large study of 5645 participants found that individuals who reported insecure attachment styles were significantly more likely to have used a variety of health care services including having had a session of psychotherapy or a prescription for pharmacological treatment of mental or behavioural problems cite{Meng2015}.
- A comprehensive study of 500 patients with psychosis from three countries found that attachment anxiety (but not avoidance) was predicted the severity of both positive and affective symptoms while both anxiety and avoidance were associated with severity of hallucinations and persecution \cite{Nieberg2015}.
- A review of three meta-analyses found a medium effect size of attachment anxiety on treatment outcome ($d=-.46$) while overall security had a smaller yet relevant effect size ($d=.37$) \cite{Levy2011}.
- Mikulincer et al \cite{Mikulincer2013}
	- Bowlby's model of therapeutic change
	- Evidence for three propositions of Bowlby's model:
		- The client's sense of security during therapy is essential to facilitating therapeutic work
		- Therapist security contributes positively to treatment effect
		- Attachment insecurities can be reduced in therapy and achieving greater security is central to realising positive treatment outcomes
	- Evidence supports Bowlby's claims that establishing a safe haven and a secure base in the therapeutic relationship is central to realising positive treatment effects.
- Alexander and Anderson's \cite{Alexander1994} description of the expected influence of the four basic attachment styles is a primarily theory-driven attempt to thoroughly account for the influence on therapeutic approach. Shorey and Snyder \cite{Shorey2006} recounts this influence for preoccupied clients as stemming from their hypersensitivity to threat cues, meaning that therapy therapists should emphasise separating intense affect form behaviour and developing emotion-regulation strategies and self-soothing. Helping these clients see that they are capable of controlling their own behaviour should be central to the therapeutic process. Based on this and other theoretically and empirically based assertions, Shorey and Snyder posit that avoidant clients may not be well suited for short-term psychotherapy and that therapists should emphasise patience and a careful challenging of clients' rigid perceptions of themselves and their presenting problems.
- Dozier, 1990
	- "She found that clinician ratings of treatment compliance were associated with the secure dimension of attachment, whereas patients who were more avoidant were less likely to seek help from their therapists, less likely to comply with treatment, and less likely to make productive use of treatment. More preoccupied patients were more likely to self-disclose than those scoring high on the avoidance dimension." (quote from Slade, 2016, p 764)
	- Given the presence of psychopathology, secure attachment makes probable that the diagnosis is affective rather than related to thought disorders.
	- More avoidant patients are more likely to reject their treatment provider and will likely engage in less self-disclosure. Providers generally rate these individuals as having poorer use of treatment.
	- Secure attachment is associated with greater compliance with treatment
- Security is positively associated with self-reported well-being \cite{Zhang2004}.

## 2.2. Therapeutic alliance
- A stand-out measure shown to have robust effects on treatment outcomes across therapist traditions and patient conditions \cite{SummersBarber2003}.
- A strong therapeutic alliance is what allows change to occur in the first place. The alliance develops and changes throughout the therapeutic process dependent on patient- and therapist characteristic and on their interactions \cite{RodgersCailholBuiEtAl2010}.
- A 2020 systematic review supports the notion of the therapeutic alliance as a mediator of change \cite{Baier2020}.
- While it is important to distinguish between the therapeutic alliance and the therapeutic relationship more broadly, they are undeniably closely related. So much so, that measures of the therapeutic relationship may functionally be surrogates for measures of the alliance in lieu of the latter.
- The link between attachment and therapeutic relationship more broadly may seem intuitive and indeed there is evidence to suggest that the patient's experience of the therapeutic relationship is influenced by their AAI classification \cite{Talia2019}.
- Weak but very robust associations between both attachment avoidance and anxiety and patient-rated alliance. Both relationships are negative, such that higher avoidance or anxiety predict worse alliance ratings \cite{Bernecker2014}. This is valuable and directly actionable insights for therapists, who may want to adjust their therapeutic approach and possibly spend more of their time and ressources on building strong alliances with their avoidant and anxious patients.
- A 2011 meta-analysis of the association between attachment style and self- and therapist-rated therapeutic alliance \cite{Diener2011} found that greater attachment security predicted stronger therapeutic alliances. This relationship was significant for both types of ratings but significantly stronger for patient ratings than therapist ratings of the alliance.
- Patients with insecure attachment have been found more likely to have weaker alliances and those with secure attachment. No significant differences in the strength of alliances were found between anxious and avoidant attachment styles in the same meta-analysis \cite{Diener2011}.
## 2.3. Attunement
Probably should just be covered in the development section and in the alliance review

## 2.4. PACS
- Utilises patient-therapist attunement behaviours to infer attachment style
- Enables repeated measures
- PACS results/performance
- Elaborate system - long training and coding process
- Slade, 2016 # New Directions: Narrative Processes... (mentions and explains PACS and the theory behind it)
## 2.5. Psychotherapy Research
- Fixed patient variable
	- Even in the view that attachment is a fixed, predetermined patient variable or considering therapists or traditions not inclined to work directly with patients' ideas of attachment, knowledge of a patient's state of mind with regard to relationships may nevertheless be beneficial. First, it may guide the therapist in how best to build and strengthen the therapeutic alliance and in designing and implementing attachment-informed interventions. Second, knowledge of a patient's attachment style can provide actionable insight into their current relationships and their state of mind regarding them as well as revealing common coping mechanisms and affect regulation strategies. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that patients of different AAI classifications engage differently in psychotherapy \cite{Slade2016, Talia2014AAI}.
	- A large body of evidence suggests that insecurely attached individuals are likely to react in nonconstructive ways in conflict and support situations \cite{Simpson2012}.
	- Shorey and Snyder \cite{Shorey2006} conclude that an understanding of attachment theory is beneficial for the conceptualisation of client problems and in the selection and design of interventions. They strongly suggest that an assessment of attachment style should be a standard part of treatment planning.
	- There is good reason to include attachement style not only in clinical work but also as an individual difference variable in psychotherapy and -pathology outcomes research \cite{Shorey2006}.
	- Patients' AAI classification may impact or mediate their experience of the therapeutic relationship \cite{talia2019patients}.
- Process variables
	- The APA dictionary defines a process variable in relation to psychotherapy as "an interpersonal, affective, cognitive, or behavioral factor that is operative during the course of psychotherapy or counseling and influences the progress or the course of behavior." \cite{APADictionaryofPsychology}
	- Reliable, low-cost therapist feedback or guidance
	- Mediator of desired outcome but not an objective itself.
	- "These results also provide information regarding the ways in which differences in attachment status play out in therapy sessions and further the study of attachment in psychotherapy from a pre-treatment client factor to a process variable." \cite{Talia2017AssessingPACS}.
- Outcome variables
	- Treating attachment or attunement as outcomes themselves
	- Allows for more reliable and comparable measure of therapy progress
